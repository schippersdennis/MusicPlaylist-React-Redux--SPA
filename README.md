# Eindopdracht-Dennis-Schippers-React-Redux-Playlist
React Playlist - Single Page Application (SPA) where you can save all your favorite songs with a rating. For my own learning curve, I chose to make this project in two different ways. One made with class-based components, the other made with Redux State management. Both projects have their own unique styling made with SCSS

### Project One - React class-based components
