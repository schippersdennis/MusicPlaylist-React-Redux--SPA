# React-Playlist
React Playlist - Single Page Application (SPA) where you can save all your favorite songs with a rating. For my own learning curve, I chose to make this project in two different ways. One made with class-based components, the other made with Redux State management. Both projects have their own unique styling made with SCSS
#### Requirements 
In order to meet the requirements of the (imaginary) employer, we expect your SPA to meet the following core functionalities:
>- As a user I would like to enter the following information about my song: title, artist, genre, rating (dropdown menu is not required).
>- As a user I want to be able to click on one button so that my entered song will be added to my playlist.
>- As a user I want to be able to see my songs in an overview (my playlist), where all entered data is visible.

#### Other conditions
>- You are completely free to build your components yourself: Stateful and / or Smart versus Dumb, or with Class components, or Functional Components (with the UseState Hook) ...
>- Sort the songs by name (a-z or z-a) or artist (a-z or z-a), sort by stars (5-1 or 1-5)
>- Delete button: delete songs from the state
>- Filter songs by genre (select which genres you want) in the UI you see either a dropdown with which you can select 1 genre, or you can create a checkbox per genre, if that checkbox is checked: show the genre (this can also be several or none. to be) stars (sort which results with x stars you want to see) in the UI you see either a dropdown with which you can select 1 rating, or you make a checkbox per rating, if that checkbox is checked: show all songs of that rating (this can be so there are also several or none)
>- React - Routing (/ Navigation): adding a navbar or menu with a link and page "About us", containing a short story about yourself and this project (max 10 sentences)
>- React REDUX
